## üìî Abstract

While lifelong SLAM addresses the capability of a robot to adapt to changes within a single environment over time, in this paper we introduce the task of continual SLAM.
Here, a robot is deployed sequentially in a variety of different environments and has to transfer its knowledge of previously experienced environments to thus far unseen environments, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
This is particularly relevant in the context of vision-based approaches, where the relevant features vary widely between different environments.
We propose a novel approach for solving the continual SLAM problem by introducing CL-SLAM.
Our approach consists of a dual-network architecture that handles both short-term adaptation and long-term memory retention by incorporating a replay buffer.
Extensive evaluations of CL-SLAM in three different environments demonstrate that it outperforms several baselines inspired by existing continual learning-based visual odometry methods.


# üèó Setup

Clone repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/robot-learning-freiburg/CL-SLAM.git`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
- Create conda environment: `conda create --name continual_slam python=3.8`
- Activate conda environment: `conda activate continual_slam`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For smooth development, install git hook scripts: `pre-commit install`

## üîÑ Install [g2opy](https://github.com/uoip/g2opy)
We use g2o for pose graph optimization.
- Apply fixes for Eigen version >= 3.3.5: `./third_party/fix_g2opy.py`
- Install C++ requirements:
  - `conda install cmake`
  - `conda install -c conda-forge eigen`
  - `conda install -c conda-forge suitesparse`
- Install g2opy:
```
cd third_party/g2opy
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DPYBIND11_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8 ..
make -j8        |NOTE: reduce number if running out of memory
cd ..
|NOTE: remove any .so file which is not for Python 3.8
python setup.py install  |NOTE: Ensure that the conda environment is active
```

## üíæ Data preparation
To re-train or run the experiments from our paper, please download and pre-process the respective datasets.

### Cityscapes
Download the following files from https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/:
- `leftImg8bit_sequence_trainvaltest.zip` (324GB)
- `timestamp_sequence.zip` (40MB)
- `vehicle_sequence.zip` (56MB)
- `disparity_sequence_trainvaltest.zip` (106GB) (optionally, used for computing the depth error)

### Oxford RobotCar
Download the RTK ground truth from https://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/ground_truth/ (91MB).
<br>Download the camera models from https://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/downloads/ (129MB).
<br>We used the files from https://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/datasets/2015-08-12-15-04-18/:
- `2015-08-12-15-04-18_stereo_centre_01.tar`, `...0*.tar` (25GB)
- `2015-08-12-15-04-18_gps.tar` (20MB)

Undistort the center images:
```python
python datasets/robotcar.py <IMG_PATH> <MODELS_PATH>
```

### KITTI
Download the KITTI Odometry data from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php:
- `odometry data set (color, 65 GB)`
- `odometry ground truth poses (4 MB)`

Download the KITTI raw data from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php for the runs specified in [`datasets/kitti.py`](datasets/kitti.py) (search for `KITTI_RAW_SEQ_MAPPING`).
- `[synced+rectified data]`

Download the ground truth depth from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth_all.php (optionally, used for computing the depth error).
- `annotated depth maps data set (14GB)`

Extract the raw data matching the odometry dataset. Note that sequence 03 is excluded as no IMU data (KITTI raw) has been released.
```python
python datasets/kitti.py <RAW_PATH> <ODOMETRY_PATH> --oxts
python datasets/kitti.py <GT_DEPTH_PATH> <ODOMETRY_PATH> --depth
```


# üèÉ Running the Code

## üèã Pre-training
We pre-trained CL-SLAM on the Cityscapes Dataset.
You can either download the resulting weights, where we masked potentially dynamic objects, or pre-train the DepthNet and PoseNet by yourself by running our code.
**Note** that you have to adjust the `dataset_path` in [`config/config_pretrain.yaml`](config/config_pretrain.yaml).
```python
python main_pretrain.py
```
Model weights: http://continual-slam.cs.uni-freiburg.de/static/models/cityscapes_masks_pretrain.zip (Please unzip the file after download.)


## üó∫Ô∏è Adaptation with CL-SLAM
For adaptation, we used the KITTI Odometry Dataset and the Oxford RobotCar Dataset.
The experiments in the paper are conducted on the KITTI sequences 09 and 10 as well as on two RobotCar sequences.
<br>In order to fill the replay buffer with the pre-training data, please run the following script after having adjusted the paths in the file.
This can take some time.
```python
python make_cityscapes_buffer.py
```
In the configuration file [`config/config_adapt.yaml`](config/config_adapt.yaml), please adjust the following parameters:
- `Dataset.dataset` --> Set either `Kitti` or `RobotCar`
- `Dataset.dataset_path` --> Set the path to the data
- `DepthPosePrediction.load_weights_folder` --> Should be the path to the weights from pre-training or the previous adaptation
- `Slam.dataset_sequence` --> Set the KITTI sequence, or `1` or `2` for RobotCar
- `Slam.logging` --> If this is set to true, make sure to enable dataloaders in the [`slam/slam.py`](slam/slam.py) have `with_depths` argument set to `True`, also make sure that you have `gt_depth` in your dataset folder

Then run:
```python
python main_adapt.py
```
